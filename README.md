# shopping-list
My solution to an exercise from ZTM course "Complete Web Developer in 2020".

Exercise about DOM events (section 12 - id 134 from this course : https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).
Initial versions of the files are provided in this course.

Initial instructions :
Using the Shopping List files from the previous videos update the shopping list app to do the following:

1. If you click on the list item, it toggles the .done  class on and off.
2. Add buttons next to each list item to delete the item when clicked on its corresponding delete button.
3. BONUS: When adding a new list item, it automatically adds the delete button next to it (hint: be sure to check if new items are clickable too!)

Note: this is my first html, css, javascript code.
